Choosing the right dog walker is an important decision that affects your pet's safety, happiness, and well-being. Here's what you need to know to make the best choice for your furry family member.

## Key Qualities to Look For

### 1. Professional Experience and Training
Look for walkers with experience handling different breeds, sizes, and temperaments. Ask about their training in dog behavior and any certifications they hold.

### 2. Bonded and Insured
Always choose a dog walking service that is fully bonded and insured. This protects you, your pet, and your property in case of accidents or incidents.

### 3. Clear Communication
Your dog walker should provide regular updates, photos, and be responsive to your questions. Good communication builds trust and keeps you informed about your pet's daily activities.

### 4. Background Checks
Reputable dog walking services conduct thorough background checks on all employees. Don't hesitate to ask about their screening process.

## Important Questions to Ask

- How do you handle emergencies?
- What is your cancellation policy?
- Do you walk dogs individually or in groups?
- Are you trained in pet first aid?
- Can you provide references from current clients?
- What happens if my dog becomes ill during a walk?

## Red Flags to Avoid

- No insurance or bonding
- Reluctance to provide references
- No meet-and-greet before the first walk
- Vague answers about experience or policies
- Unwillingness to show credentials
